# Ubuntu 24.04's default-jsk is jdk 21 (LTS) which is currently the sensible
# choice. I don't see much point in using sdkman or other tools to manage
# multiple versions as I am very unlikely to need them.
#
# Also, direct installation like this means the Java binaries are available
# immediately to downstream scripts, no need to start a new shell.

sudo apt -y install default-jdk
