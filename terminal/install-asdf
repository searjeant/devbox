# Install the latest Erlang / OTP release.
#
# Without using asdf or mise, this is a slightly clunky process
# which depends on the OS release to select the right version.
# I'm using Noble (24.04) and there's currently no specific release for it.
# Go here: https://binaries2.erlang-solutions.com/#
# Navigate down to # https://binaries2.erlang-solutions.com/#ubuntu/dists/
# The latest is Jammy.

# ASDF (which uses Kerl) may be the best option. https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html

# Pre-reqs. Probably already there, buit in case:
sudo apt -y install curl git unzip

# If the ~/.asdf directory already exists, the clone below will fail.
rm -rf ~/.asdf

# Clone the asdf tool to current user's profile. Don't like the specific branch
# version, but this is the official guidance.  Would prefer just 'latest'.
git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.15.0

# Set up PATH etc. for all new shells.
echo ". $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
echo ". $HOME/.asdf/completions/asdf.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
