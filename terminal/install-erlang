# Install the latest Erlang / OTP release.
# Depends on some library pre-reqs: libraries.sh should already
# have installed these.
# Depends on asdf, so this should run after install-asdf.
# Also, this needs to be run in a new shell (bash -c <name>) 
# so that asdf's shell config is picked up.

# Add the Erlang plugin. See https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang
asdf plugin add erlang https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang.git

# We can get the latest version
# https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_5-install-a-version
asdf install erlang latest

# And make the latest version the default, globally:
asdf global erlang latest
